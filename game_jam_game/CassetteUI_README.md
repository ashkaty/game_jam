# Cassette UI Element

## Overview
The Cassette UI Element is a retro-styled information display that shows player stats and other game information. It's designed to look like a cassette tape interface, providing a nostalgic aesthetic to your game.

## Features
- **Player Stats Display**: Shows health, score, level, and experience
- **Retro Cassette Design**: Uses the provided cassette UI asset for visual appeal
- **Customizable Information**: Can display custom messages and information
- **Toggle Functionality**: Press TAB to show/hide the UI
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatically updates player information when displayed

## Controls
- **TAB**: Toggle the Cassette UI on/off
- **Ã— Button**: Close the UI (same as TAB)

## Usage in Game
The Cassette UI automatically connects to the player and displays:
- **Health**: Current health / Maximum health
- **Score**: Current player score
- **Level**: Current player level
- **Custom Info**: Any additional information set by the game

## Testing the Implementation
Once implemented, you can test the Cassette UI with these controls:
- **Attack** (Enter/Shift): Adds 10 points to score
- **Crouch** (S): Damages player by 5 health points
- **Up** (W): Heals player by 10 health points  
- **Jump** (Space): Adds 25 experience points

## Integration
The Cassette UI is already integrated into your main game scene (`game.tscn`) and will automatically:
1. Find the player in the scene
2. Connect to player stats
3. Update in real-time when visible
4. Respond to the TAB key for toggling
